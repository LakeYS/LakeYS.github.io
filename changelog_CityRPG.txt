<version:0.1.1>
	<b>Alpha 1 Patch</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Added a new default CityRPG build.</li>
		<li>Replaced the default colorset with Trueno's Colorset</li>
		<li>Drastically optimized the antiquated data saver. CPU usage and response times have significantly improved, fixing instances of the server choking with higher player counts and/or larger maps. This is only a band-aid fix until the saver is replaced, but it brings significant performance improvements.</li>
		<li>The game-mode now modifies the doPlayerTeleport add-on if it is enabled; the "Relative" option is disabled to prevent players from phasing through walls with it.</li>
	</ul>
