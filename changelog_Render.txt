Updated pref names. The reveal:

Self-Defense (Mystery Update A) 
By popular request, you can now use weapons against Render! There is a preference to toggle this on or off. 

Tag Mode (Mystery Update B)
This is a new mode that can be enabled under the preferences menu. In tag mode, it is safe to look at Render at any time. Don't let him catch you, though...
